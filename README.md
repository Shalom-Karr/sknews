## About The Project

SK News is a modern, dynamic web platform for a text-based news service tailored for the Yeshiva community. The project's core mission is to deliver reliable, kosher-filtered news updates, community information, and engaging discussions directly to users' phones.

The website serves as a central hub for all SK News services. It provides clear pathways for users to join various news and community chats via SMS or GroupMe, learn about the organization, and view a live feed of breaking news. The site features a clean, professional design that is fully responsive and accessible on all devices.

A key feature of this project is its integration with a Supabase backend, which powers a secure admin panel for content management and a real-time, dynamic news feed on the public-facing site.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Live Feed:** The homepage features a live feed that fetches and displays news updates in real-time from the Supabase database.
*   **Secure Admin Panel:** A password-protected `/admin.html` page allows authorized users to log in and post new items directly to the live feed.
*   **Multi-Page Architecture:** A comprehensive, well-structured site with dedicated landing pages for each news service and community chat.
*   **Netlify Forms Integration:** Uses Netlify's native form handling for the contact page, eliminating the need for third-party services.
*   **Fully Responsive Design:** The UI is built with modern CSS to provide a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **SEO Optimized:** Includes a `sitemap.xml` for efficient indexing, a `robots.txt` file to guide crawlers, and descriptive meta tags on the homepage for better search results and social media sharing.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a focus on modern, lightweight, and powerful technologies:

*   **Frontend:**
    *   HTML5
    *   CSS3 (with custom properties for theming)
    *   Vanilla JavaScript (for DOM manipulation and interactions)
*   **Backend & Database:**
    *   [**Supabase**](https://supabase.com/): Used for the PostgreSQL database, user authentication (for the admin panel), and real-time data fetching.
*   **Hosting & Deployment:**
    *   [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/): For continuous deployment, hosting, and serverless form handling.

## Setup and Local Development

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need a free [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/) account.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Create a Supabase Project:**
    *   Go to your Supabase dashboard and create a new project.
    *   Save your **Project URL** and **anon (public) key**.

3.  **Create the Supabase Client File:**
    *   In the root of the project, create a file named `supabase-client.js`.
    *   Paste the following code into it, replacing the placeholder values with your actual Supabase URL and Key:
        ```javascript
        import { createClient } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js/+esm';

        const SUPABASE_URL = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL';
        const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY';

        export const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
        ```

4.  **Set up the Database Table:**
    *   In your Supabase project, navigate to the **SQL Editor**.
    *   Click **"+ New query"** and paste the entire script below to create the `feed` table and set up security rules.
        ```sql
        -- 1. Create the 'feed' table
        CREATE TABLE public.feed (
            id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
            created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
            title text NULL,
            content text NULL,
            timestamp text NULL
        );

        COMMENT ON TABLE public.feed IS 'Stores all the live feed items for the website.';

        -- 2. Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
        ALTER TABLE public.feed ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

        -- 3. Create Policies for Access Control
        CREATE POLICY "Public feed items are viewable by everyone."
        ON public.feed FOR SELECT USING (true);

        CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can add new feed items."
        ON public.feed FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (true);
        ```

5.  **Create an Admin User:**
    *   In your Supabase project, navigate to **Authentication**.
    *   Click **"Add user"** and then **"Create User"**.
    *   Enter the email and a secure password you will use to log in on the `/admin.html` page.
    *   **Disable "Auto Confirm User"** to make the account active immediately.
    *   Click **"Create user"**.

6.  **Run Locally:**
    *   You can now open the `index.html` file in your browser. For best results (and to avoid CORS issues with JavaScript modules), use a simple local server extension like "Live Server" for VS Code.
